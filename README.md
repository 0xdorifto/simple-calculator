# Simple Solidity Calculator

This is a simple project to study and better understand inheritance in solidity.

To use this project as intended, create the following files:

- `.etherscan` containing your Etherscan key.
- `.infura` containing your Infura key.
- `.secret` containing your wallet's private key.

#### MAKE SURE THESE FILES ARE LISTED ON `.gitignore` SO YOU DON'T EXPOSE YOUR KEYS, ESPECIALLY THE PRIVATE KEYS
